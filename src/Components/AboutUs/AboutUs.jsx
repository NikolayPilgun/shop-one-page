					<h3>The Biography of William Shakespeare</h3>
					<p>
						William Shakespeare was born in 1564 in a small English city
						Stratford-upon-Avon, which thanks to him has become one of the most
						frequently visited places in England. William Shakespeare is also
						considered to be the father of sonnets. All in all he wrote more
						than 37 plays, 154 sonnets, two long poems and a great number of
						other poems. The main genres of Shakespeare’s works were tragedies
						and comedies. Almost all his literary works have been translated
						into more than 30 languages.
					</p>
					<p>
						His most famous works include such plays as “Romeo and Juliet”,
						“Hamlet”, “King Lear”, “Othello”, and many others. It’s remarkable
						that Shakespeare’s plays were staged in London in 1952, which means
						that he gained fame already in his 30s. Although a real
						acknowledgement of his works and high approval took place only in
						the 19th century. The era of Romanticism regarded Shakespeare as a
						genius and a lot of other writers got inspiration from his works.
